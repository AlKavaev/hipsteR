## hipsteR: re-educating people who learned R before it was cool

I was an early adopter of [R](http://www.r-project.org), having first
learned S (yay!) and then S-plus (yuck!). But at times my knowledge of
R seems stuck in 2001. I keep finding out about &ldquo;new&rdquo; R
functions (like `replicate`, which was new in _2002_).

This is a tutorial for people like me.
